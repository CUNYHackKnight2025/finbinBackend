# Fixing GitHub Deployment Error in Azure App Service

## Error Explanation

The error you're seeing occurs because:

1. Your GitHub repository has **branch protection rules** enabled
2. These rules require changes to be made through pull requests
3. There are **3 required status checks** that must pass before merging changes
4. Azure App Service deployment is trying to push code directly to your repository, violating these rules

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use GitHub Actions Instead (Recommended)

1. **Disconnect** the current GitHub integration in your App Service
2. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow:
   
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml
   name: Deploy to Azure
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   
   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       
       - name: Set up .NET
         uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
         with:
           dotnet-version: '9.0.x'  # Adjust to your .NET version
           
       - name: Build
         run: dotnet build --configuration Release
         
       - name: Publish
         run: dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
         
       - name: Deploy to Azure
         uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
         with:
           app-name: 'finbinbackend'
           publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
           package: './publish'
   ```

3. Get your publish profile from the Azure portal:
   - Go to your App Service
   - Select "Overview" → "Get publish profile" 
   - Add this as a GitHub Secret named `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`

### Option 2: Modify Branch Protection Rules

If you prefer using Azure's built-in deployment:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
3. Find the rule for your main branch
4. Either:
   - Temporarily disable protection rules
   - Add an exception for the Azure service account
   - Reduce the required status checks

### Option 3: Use Manual Deployment

1. Publish your application locally using Visual Studio or CLI:
   ```
   dotnet publish -c Release
   ```
2. Use the Azure CLI to deploy:
   ```
   az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group rg-foundrysandbox --name finbinbackend --src ./bin/Release/net9.0/publish/publish.zip
   ```

## Recommended Approach

Use GitHub Actions (Option 1) as it:
- Respects your branch protection rules
- Provides clear CI/CD pipelines
- Gives you control over the build and deployment process
- Works well with your existing GitHub setup
